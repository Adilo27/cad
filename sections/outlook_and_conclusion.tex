\section{Outlook and Conclusion}
In this report, we worked on reproducing the work of the paper \cite{1905.02666}. When we compare our result we get with the quantum computer and compare it with the result of the exact value we are  close to the exact result. But do not fit into the confidence interval unless a MLE estimation is used.\\
After investigating these problems we can apply Amplitude Estimation to even more complicated options types like path dependent once. Also generic functions can be fitted with piece-wise linear function and more research can be done on how to use the fitted linear functions in Amplitude Estimation.
