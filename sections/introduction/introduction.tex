\section{Introduction}\label{sec: introduction}
\subsection*{Foreword}
This report was originally intended as a report for the course Introduction to Quantum Computing at the University of Twente. Both the report and the course are provided by ING employees. Initially, the report was meant to show maturity in quantum computing of the students attending the course. However, it became quickly interesting to upstream the report into a tutorial for, mostly colleagues, who would like to have a step-by-step introduction to quantum computing and to execute Monte Carlo simulations on such computers. The report is going to be a living document and will be updated from time to time as the field of Monte Carlo simulations on quantum computers advances and the author's experiences too. Lastly, the Monte Carlo simulations are applied in the domain of (quantitative) finance, thus, covering the financial problems too in the report. We hope that this report meets its requirements as a standalone document for the quantum computing enthusiasts in the financial world.
