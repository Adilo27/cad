\section{Introduction}
In this work we will present how to compute the pricing of an option on a quantum computer and compare this with a classical Monte Carlo simulation.
We go over the steps to build a call option on a gate-based quantum computer, for example the IBM Q Tokyo. We use qiskit (\cite{Qiskit}) a python module to connect the gates and qubits and simulate the result.
Therefor we try to rebuild the logic of the gate-based quantum computer described in this paper \cite{1905.02666}.
